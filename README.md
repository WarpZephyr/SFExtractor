# SFExtractor
This program extracts many different types of SoulsFormats file types.

# Building
MAY NOT BE CORRECT RIGHT NOW  
If you want to build the project you should clone it with this command in git bash:  
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/WarpZephyr/SFExtractor.git  
```
Then build it in visual studio

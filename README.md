# ACFAModelReplacer
This program currently replaces ACFA models with Dark Souls 1 models  
That conversion even is not complete yet  

I am working on dumping mtds and buffer layouts so I can get full proper conversion  
After that I will work on FBX to ACFA model conversion

# Building
If you want to build the project you should clone it with this command in git bash:  
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/WarpZephyr/ACFAModelEditor.git  
```
Then build it in visual studio
